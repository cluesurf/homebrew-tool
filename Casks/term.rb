  version "2.9.2"

  # One release layer per platform, published by `pnpm term:release`
  # to ghcr.io/cluesurf/term/code. A layer's OCI digest IS the sha256 of
  # the tarball, so the same value is both the download address and the
  # checksum Homebrew verifies. Generated: keep the keys as they are.
